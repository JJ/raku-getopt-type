# Getopt::Type:auth<zef:jjmerelo> [![Test-install distro](https://github.com/JJ/raku-getopt-type/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JJ/raku-getopt-type/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Forked from [`tadzik`s](https://github.com/tadzik/Getopt-Type) version

## MAIN? Getopt semantics? Why not both?

```raku
use Getopt::Type:auth<zef:jjmerelo>;

sub MAIN(*%opts where getopt(<f|force v|verbose>)) {
    say "Forcing!"   if %opts<force>;
    say "Verbosing!" if %opts<verbose>;
    say %opts.raku;
}

```

Save as `thisprog.raku` and try `raku -Ilib thisprog.raku -fv`
